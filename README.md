## `Description`

### An app to plan a bar tour with your friends - wherever you want!

Planing a bar tour with your friends is easy now. 4 Paramters, less than a
minute of planning and you are off to a great evening with your friends! planBar
lets you select a start position, a destination, the amount of bars you want to
visit on your bar tour and the radius, based off your starting location, in
which you want to make the tour. Don't like a bar on the tour? Just remove it.
Maybe add another bar from your area to your tour, it will dynamically update
your tour to the optimal route. Some spicey challenges await you in each bar on
your route, so better watch out for those!
